## Docstring

Here's a starter docstring for your solutions. Feel free to rewrite it if that helps you understand:

```js
/**
 * Sorts an array of numbers from smallest to largest to largest.
 *
 * Returns a new array without modifying the original array.
 *
 * Does not need to support: NaN, Infinity, -Infinity.
 *
 * @param {number[]} [arrayOfNumbers=[]] - the array of numbers to sort
 * @returns {number[]} a new array with the same numbers, but sorted
 * @example
 *
 * sortNumbers([1.5, 1, -1.5, 0, -1]);
 * // -> [-1.5, -1, 0, 1, 1.5]
 */
```

- use a built-in method to flatten an array.

the concat() and apply(). We pass 2 arguments to the apply method. An empty array and the array we declared above(array) then concatenate all the elements(sub-arrays) passed into an empty array thus obtaining a flattened array.

## Use Cases

this method can be use in practical case like to merge stocks data which have similar catagories

# Intersection

Write a function that finds all the values shared between two arrays.
Repeated values are not duplicated in the return value, and the order of result values are determined by the first array.

**Note:** This function returns a new array, and has no side-effects.

## Docstring

Here's a starter docstring for your solutions. Feel free to rewrite it if that helps you understand:

```js
/**
 * Creates an array of values that are in both the first and the second arrays.
 *
 * Repeated values are not duplicated in the return value, and the order of result values are determined by the first array.
 *
 * **Note:** This function returns a new array, and has no side-effects.
 *
 * @param {Array} [array=[]] - The array to inspect.
 * @param {Array} [values=[]] - The values to include.
 * @returns {Array} Returns the new array of filtered values.
 * @example
 *
 * intersection([2, 1], [2, 3]);
 * // -> [2]
 *
 * @example
 *
 * intersection([2, 1, 2], [2, 3]);
 * // -> [2]
 */
```

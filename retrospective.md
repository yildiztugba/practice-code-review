# Retrospective

This group project had as advantage the benefit of being smaller than previous. And way more self committed about coding.
<!--
  compare your Development Strategy to your Project Board
  how different was your planned tasks from what you actually built?
  building something very different from your plan is not a bad thing!
  what counts is that you learn from your mistakes and make a better plan next time.
-->

## Stop Doing

- Not setting a deadline. Even if sadly it is difficult for most of all to fully work daily in the project because of personal issues, without a suggested deadline, sometimes we are not programming ourselves for having a finished result. 
<!--
  what did your group do that did not go very well
  agree to stop doing this in the next project
  this could be about anything. communication, code, review, ...
  examples (be specific!):
  - pushing changes directly to master/main branch
  - claiming more issues at once than you can finish
-->

## Continue Doing

- Subdivide the whole group into smaller fractions for a most effective way of communication and solve problems and issues P2P.

- Double check always our code with the useful scripts for ` format ` ` lint ` ` test ` ` document `.  

<!--
  what did your group that worked vwell
  agree to keep doing these in the next project
  this could be about anything. communication, code, review, ...
  examples (be specific!):
  - making small, well-named commits
  - using the `help-wanted` label
-->

## Start Doing

- Ask for more help and support from our partners but specially from the coaches who had all the experience and expertise for helping us to solve our technical issues.
<!--
  what ideas does your group have for making a better project next time?
  agree to give these things a try in the next projec
  this could be about anything. communication, code, review, ...
  examples (be specific!):
  - use @mentions more often
  - use the github integration in slack. /github
